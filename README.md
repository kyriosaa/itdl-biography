# Interactive Technology and Digital Learning Final Project

## About

- A website that gives the biography of Lyn Shun-Lien Sung by incorporating different elements such as an AI chatbot using ChatGPT, image generation using DALL-E, and a notes editor.
- Code written in JavaScript, CSS, SCSS, and HTML

## Features

- **Dynamic Elements -** Displays a dynamic website with interactable components.
- **Navigation Bar -** Includes a navigation bar for quick navigation between pages.
- **Biography -** Gives a comprehensive biography of Taiwanese scientist Lyn Shun-Lien Sung.
- **Timeline -** Shows an interactive timeline of Lyn Shun-Lien Sung's career.
- **Notable Works -** Lists Lyn Shun-Lien Sung's notable works.
- **AI Chatbot -** Includes an interactive AI chatbot that users can talk to. This component uses ChatGPT's language model API.
- **Image Generation -** Includes an image generation page where users can generate images related to Lyn Shun-Lien Sung. This component uses DALL-E's image generation API.
- **Notes Editor -** Provides a page where users can note anything significant down. The component doesn't have a database and therefore will not save the notes but since this final project is meant to be a dive into the use of AI in projects, I think it is safe to leave it out since adding a database would complicate the presentation.
